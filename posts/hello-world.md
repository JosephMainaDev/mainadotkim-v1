## Me

Hi there! Nice to meet you. I am **Kimani Maina**, an engineer from Nairobi, *NBO*, [Kenya](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya).

I am a self-taught developer, on a journey to learning how to make web sites and web apps.

My focus right now is to get better at ReactJS, React-router 4 and Redux.

## This Blog

This blog has been a journey to that end. My aim is to share my journey with others who could be travelling along the same path. I am sharing code examples, tips and tricks from HTML, CSS and JS.

I coded it from scratch as a way of practicing what I have learnt thus far. And, it is a work in progress.

## Tools I used

The blog is a static site built with [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs), a [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/reactjs) based [SSG](https://jamstack.com).

It is hosted for free by the lovely people at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), who happen to also host the domain.

Have you realised how fast the site is? Thank you Static Site Generators!

You should consider building your blog with a static site generator like Hugo, GatsbyJS or their more popular brother: Jekyll.

## But before this

The first version of this blog was built with [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) :). However, it never "saw the light of day." I did it as a way of learning and practising my new found skills of frontend development, viz. HTML, CSS and frontend libraries like the most popular CSS framework [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com).

I really had no intention of hosting it or writing content for the blog. It was a nice learning experience. I actually hosted the code on [GitHub](github.com) before I changed all that to what it is now.

## The journey

If you are learning to code by the way I would recommend that you find a project that you would love to build and *finish*. I can gurantee that what you will learn as a result is so valuable. You learn much more than merely going through tutorials. But I will tell you more about that V0 blog I had built on a later post.

As I built V0, I continued doing the lessons at [freeCodeCamp](www.freeCodeCamp.org)

This time concentrating on the JS parts. But I didn't have all the time in the world. So I stopped and went straight to ReactJS. But, I ensured that I had all the javascript basics before I did - so I would hit fewer roadblocks.

That journey was even more fulfilling than my experience with Jekyll + Bootstrap.

But before long, I discovered how ~not so useful~ my new found skills would be without real practice. So I began building this blog. Come to think of it... A blog built with ReactJS as the front end? Isn't it crazy? And is it even worth the effort?

So I began my search on the simplest app I could build with the ReactJS knowledge. And WHOA! I stumbled upon GatsbyJS. Wait! What is that?

I could build my site with react, generate a static version of the site with the help of gatsbyjs and there you have it: a static site built with ReactJS + GatsbyJS + the power of JavaScript.

That is how the version V1 of my blog came to be. 

And challenges I did face. But all those taught me lessons worth the effort. It is styled with Styled Components.

## Kim, what are you going to blog about? I hear you ask.

I am passionate about young people. I believe that the youth are making a difference in this world. Be it in business, education, entrepreneurship, employment (though scarce), innovation, governance, technology . . . name it!

The youth in Kenya, in Africa and all over the world can do even more. If only they are empowered, mentored and guided, to do what they do best.

I think that will be my major topic. The young of Africa. Those people who only need wings to start flying. They have the courage, passion and energy to do it.

Those people will be majority of my audience.

Plus, I have to rescue people who want to learn software development. So I will be chipping in an element of software development along the way.
